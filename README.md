# MAX11613
MAX11613 emulation with Arduino pro-mini, for use with PA3GSB's Radioberry

In Argentina isn't cheap or easy to buy the original chip.

An Arduino pro-mini are easy and cheap!

Remember!: if you are using an 5 volts pro-mini instead the 3,3vols ones, YOU NEED TO  USE LEVEL SHIFTER ON SDA/SDL LINES!!!
